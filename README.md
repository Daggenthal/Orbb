# Orbb

I originally created this as a way to rapidly backup, transfer, and restore settings that I mainly use for what I help with.

This was built with a very specific purpose in mind, but can easily be expanded for other tasks!

This took me roughly 4 hours to do, with trial-and-error + bug squashing.
